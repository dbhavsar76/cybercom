TLDR; TIL -

js object, prototype, inheritance
constructor functions, safe constructor
function vs arrow function

class in js is called constructor or prototype (it's not the case)

every js object has prototype property
it's used in inheritance

constructors are just functions...
so it can be called without new keyword..which will modify global context instead of new object
this can be mitigated by scopesafe constructor by adding few lines in the constructor.
example, 
    function MyObject(args..) {
        // line to make constructor scope-safe
        // if there is no new keyword..then call with new keyword
        if (!(this instanceof MyObject)) return new MyObject(args..);
        
        // else go with initiallizations
        this.xx = xx;
        ...
    }


Arrow Functions vs Functions

Arrow functions are made to execute shart pieces of code in current context.
They dont have their own "context".
And thats why they dont have -
this, super, .arguments (every thing is of enclosing or rather current context)

since they dont have this, they cant be called with new and act as a constructor.

Prototypes
i'm understanding prototypes but it's just not clicking right. Well, we'll see...
Ohh...i was confusing prototypes and classes...but prototypes are from before classes.
I think i'm getting it now.
