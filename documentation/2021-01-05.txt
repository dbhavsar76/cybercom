Today i started learning about using git and github.
How to manage local and remote repository with them.

First watched a couple of youtube videos which quickly explains about git, various basic commands of git and github. Then went over the reference document provided by Chirag Nandaniya Sir.
Then started experimenting with other git commands.
Found a great website for reference : https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
Tried above mentioned commands with different options.
Experimented with branching, merging, rebasing.
Tried various scenarios involving branches.
Had some problem with rebase.
Tried reverting and reseting to previous commits.

For tomorrow:
i'd like to (atleast) do
- experiment with rebase
- create conflict and explore various ways to resolve them
- experiment on colaboration repository
