Sorry for turning in late,

But i made a huge mistake, I forgot the main focus was on logic.
I tried to make everything more generilized and ended up over engineering the code.
So it took more time than i expected.

* All database interactions (queries) are in the files in the Model folder.
* I've also atteched the sql file for database structure.

Most of features and database interactions works but it still has many bugs.
I'll try to make it better WHEN i get the time.
